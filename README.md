# Files and Folders: 

#### A one-to-many Spring application using Spring annotations

The application should have the following models: 
- [x] Folders
- [x] Files
- [x] Users
- [x] Users should have many folders
- [x] folders should have many files.
- [x] need to create repositories for each entity.
- [x] need to create controllers for each entity, too, and ensure they implement the index, create and show routes.
- [x] A seeding file DataLoader component to pre-seed the database.
- [ ] Test the routes with Insomnia

# MVP
Create a system to track files and folders:

1. A File should have:
- [x] a name
- [x] extension (e.g. txt, rb, java, ppt)
- [x] size
- [x] folder
2. A User should have:
- [x] name
- [x] a list of folders
3. A Folder should have:
- [x] a title
- [x] list of files
- [x] a user
